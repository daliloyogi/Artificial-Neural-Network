In a recent artificial neural network (ANN) exercise, I started by loading data from a CSV file using pandas. Then I pre-process the data  by removing unnecessary columns like customer name, email address, country, and gender. I also checked and handled missing values, if any.

Next, I explored the data by creating a scatter plot to examine the relationship between annual salary and credit card debt. Additionally, I used seaborn to create a pair chart, which provides a comprehensive overview of the distribution and correlation between variables. Then I split the data into features (X) and target variables (y) to train the model.

I used MinMaxScaler to normalize the feature and target values to range from 0 to  1. Then I split the data into training and test sets using train_test_split. I trained a linear regression model and measured its performance score. At the same time, I created and trained an ANN with two layers, using ReLU activation  in the hidden layer and linear activation in the output layer. The model is evaluated using the mean squared error as the loss function.

After training both models, I evaluated their performance by calculating the R-squared score for linear regression and looked at visualizing the training and validation results  for the ANN. I also introduced the confusion matrix and classification rate to the ANN model in the testing phase. 

These results provide an overall understanding of how the classification model responds to the experimental data. Engaging in data mining, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation, this exercise provides a comprehensive overview of ANN implementations for regression and classification tasks.
